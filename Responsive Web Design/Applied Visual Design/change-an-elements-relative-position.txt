<!---each HTML element is treated as its own box(CSS box model), block-level items automatically start on a new line while inline items sit within surrounding content, default layout of elements in this way is called "normal flow" but CSS has the "position" property to override it
  -relative: relative to current position in normal flow of page, pairs w/ offset properties of left/right/top/bottom which tell how many em/pixel/percentage to move away from normal position--->

<style>
  h2 {
    position: relative;
    top: 15px;
  }
</style>
<body>
  <h1>On Being Well-Positioned</h1>
  <h2>Move me!</h2>
  <p>I still think the h2 is where it normally sits.</p>
</body>
