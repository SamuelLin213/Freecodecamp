# Bag of words: simplest approach to encode data, each word is encoded with integer
    # and thrown into collection that doesn't maintain order of words but does keep
    # track of frequency
# E.g. Movie review analyzer: check if review is positive or negative

vocab = {}  # maps word to integer representing it
word_encoding = 1
def bag_of_words(text):
  global word_encoding

  words = text.lower().split(" ")  # create a list of all of the words in the text, well assume there is no grammar in our text for this example
  bag = {}  # stores all of the encodings and their frequency

  for word in words:
    if word in vocab:
      encoding = vocab[word]  # get encoding from vocab
    else:
      vocab[word] = word_encoding
      encoding = word_encoding
      word_encoding += 1

    if encoding in bag:
      bag[encoding] += 1
    else:
      bag[encoding] = 1

  return bag

text = "this is a test to see if this test will work is is test a a"
bag = bag_of_words(text)
print(bag)
print(vocab)

# The drawback of bag of words is that the order of words is lost; i.e. this example:
positive_review = "I thought the movie was going to be bad but it was actually amazing"
negative_review = "I thought the movie was going to be amazing but it was actually bad"

pos_bag = bag_of_words(positive_review)
neg_bag = bag_of_words(negative_review)

print("Positive:", pos_bag)
print("Negative:", neg_bag)
