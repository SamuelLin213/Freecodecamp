//lookheads: patterns that tell JS to look-ahead in string to check for patterns later on
//two types of lookaheads: positive and negative
//positive looks ahead to ensure the element in search pattern is there but doesn't actually match it
//  -used as (?=...) where ... is the required part that's not matched
//negative looks ahead to make sure element in search pattern is not there
//  -used as (?!...) where ... is the pattern that you do not want to be there; rest of the pattern is returned if the negative lockahead part is not present
